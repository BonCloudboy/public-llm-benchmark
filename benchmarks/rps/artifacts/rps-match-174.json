They also played Paper twice in a row.\n\n- **Consider winning strategies:**\n    - If they play Scissors again (based on Round 4), you should play Rock.\n    - If they revert to playing Paper (based on Rounds 1 & 3), you should play Scissors.\n\n- **Predict opponent's next move:** The opponent has played Scissors twice, and Paper twice. There isn't a definitive repeating pattern. However, their last move was Scissors. They might stick with it, or try to counter your perceived strategy.\n\n- **Choose a move:** Given the opponent played Scissors last, and you lost to it, it's risky to play",
